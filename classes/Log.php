	/**
	 * (PHP 4, PHP 5)<br/>
	 * Return a formatted string
	 * @link http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php
	 * @param string $format <p>
	 * The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
	 * ordinary characters (excluding %) that are
	 * copied directly to the result, and conversion
	 * specifications, each of which results in fetching its
	 * own parameter. This applies to both sprintf
	 * and printf.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Each conversion specification consists of a percent sign
	 * (%), followed by one or more of these
	 * elements, in order:
	 * An optional sign specifier that forces a sign
	 * (- or +) to be used on a number. By default, only the - sign is used
	 * on a number if it's negative. This specifier forces positive numbers
	 * to have the + sign attached as well, and was added in PHP 4.3.0.
	 * @param mixed $args [optional] <p>
	 * </p>
	 * @param mixed $_ [optional]
	 * @return string a string produced according to the formatting string
	 * format.
